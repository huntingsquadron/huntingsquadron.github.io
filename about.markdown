This blog is created by 4 cybersecurity passionates with years of experience in hunting cybercriminals, threat actors, state-sponsored hackers, and other internet wrongdoers. We strive to deliver you the best content, mostly around the topic of threat hunting and detection engineering, but also we like to touch upon other blue team fields, such as incident response, malware analysis, threat intelligence, and others.
